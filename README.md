# EntryX – Grants Access

## In The Real World - Decentralized - Open Source

## Inspiration

Bringing companies more customers while making people's lives easier by using my two passions - mechatronic and software engineering - is why I founded EntryX.

## What it does

EntryX is an electronic device that enables everything from a one-time workout at the gym to access to Airbnb/hotel rooms and parking in a parking garage with a single XRP transaction. For around $12 (hardware cost), anyone from consumers to large enterprises can use the XRPL to make their life easier or scale their business.
Gym, Airbnb/hotel, parking garage, airport lounges, tanning salons, public restrooms,… What do all these industries have in common? Right, they only have to open a door!
With EntryX you just need to scan a QR code on one of those doors, pay the desired amount in XRP and the door will open automatically.
So what it actually does is make life easier. Consumers save a lot of time and energy and companies gain customers and lower their costs.
Having an XRPL account means having access – this is EntryX’s understanding of Creating Real World Impact.

## How we built it

EntryX is built on affordable, reliable hardware that is available to everyone. Building an EntryX device costs around $12 and can be done by almost anyone.
An ESP32, a relay, 2 LED's and a button - that's all you need. Of course you can also buy a ready-made one from EntryX. Any electrician anywhere in the world will be happy to install such a device for you in minutes.
The device itself is programmed in C++ and the Node server is written in Typescript and uses xrpljs to connect to the XRPL websocket.

## What’s possible

Ready to use out of the box or fully customized – everything is possible from plug-and-play to the definition of thousands of specific requirements.
It can operate both as a standalone device (plug and play) or in a cluster of thousands of devices connected to a server. Both codes are included in the GitHub repository.

### The possibilities of EntryX exceed your imagination

Fingerprints, iris scan, multi-sig, real-time XRPL account KYC status and even weather data (real-time or forecast) can be used to adjust prices or check if the door should open. However, charging an entry fee is only a small part of what EntryX can be used for. Combine a fingerprint reader and real-time KYC data and let your imagination run wild…

## Challenges we ran into

After many years of working with microcontrollers, electronic circuits and the XRPL, development has been pretty straight forward. However, working with Hooks and NFTs for an NFT-based subscription model was a bit difficult at first. Finding a manufacturer for a top quality product and identifying the needs for different businesses (hotels, gyms, car parks, car washes, ...) is quite a challenge and makes it very interesting.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Real World: EntryX is a product where blockchain actually makes people's real life easier and brings companies more customers.
Equality: Anyone can afford such a device and get more sales right away. Sustainability: The device can be used in a cluster of 100 hotel rooms today and as a standalone device in a gym tomorrow – it's built to last for decades and can be reused indefinitely. And last but not least, it's a way to bring the benefits of the XRPL into the everyday lives of Average Jane and Joe.

## What we learned

It seems unlikely that an AI-based NFT-assisted machine learning DAO DApp will bring blockchain technology to the real world. The Power of Simplicity - Breaking things down into a product that is easy for the layperson to understand and use will get it there.
And the most interesting thing – that’s a work in progress - is how to go from prototype to mass production.

## What's next for EntryX

Adding more new sketches for different business models.
Completion of the user interface for the EntryX server.
Fixing a deal with a producer.
Open sourcing of all different code examples, circuit diagrams and tutorials.
Preparing for the “Hooks-Amendment” to take the service to a whole new level with an automated NFT-based subscription model.
Sales launch.

Start working on DrinX – guess what that is about ;)
